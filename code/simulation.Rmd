## Distance between 2 random points

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
dist<-NULL
for(i in 1:10000){
  tmp <- runif(4)
  tmp2 <-abs(tmp[2]-tmp[1])+abs(tmp[4]-tmp[3])
  dist<-c(dist,tmp2)
}
mean(dist)

dist<-NULL
for(i in 1:10000){
  tmp <- runif(4)
  tmp2 <-((tmp[2]-tmp[1])^2+(tmp[4]-tmp[3])^2)^(1/2)
  dist<-c(dist,tmp2)
}
mean(dist)

runif(4)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
